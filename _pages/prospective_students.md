Thanks for your interest in joining the UMD Multisensory Machine Intelligence Lab and working with me! Due to the high volume of email inquiries I receive, I apologize in advance that I may be unable to respond to each one individually. Please review the following information before reaching out.

- ***Prospective Ph.D. students:*** If you are interested in working with me, please [apply here](https://www.cs.umd.edu/grad/catalog) and list me as a potential advisor in your application.

- ***Current UMD Ph.D. Students:*** Please email me directly with your CV, a short summary of your research background, and how I can help with your research.

- ***Current UMD Master and Undergraduate Students:*** If you are interested in conducting research in our group, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLaJ3yBWQGZ0h1vWVXDDhl-NE42vPTxgtrIHxLjHiLrqv7sQ/viewform). We regularly monitor form submissions, and will be in touch if we think you are a good fit for our research projects.

- ***Prospective Visiting Students/Interns:*** If you are from another institution and interested in summer internships or a short-term visit to our group, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLaJ3yBWQGZ0h1vWVXDDhl-NE42vPTxgtrIHxLjHiLrqv7sQ/viewform). Generally, we only consider students who can commit to at least 6 months of research.

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to potentially working with you!

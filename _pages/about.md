I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://umd.edu/">University of Maryland, College Park</a>, where I am leading the UMD Multisensory Machine Intelligence Lab. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [The University of Texas at Austin](http://www.utexas.edu/) advised by [Kristen Grauman](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman), and then spent two years as a PostDoc at [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab](https://svl.stanford.edu/) working with [Fei-Fei Li](https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li), [Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/), and [Silvio Savarese](https://profiles.stanford.edu/silvio-savarese).

My research primarily focuses on computer vision and machine learning with a particular emphasis on multisensory machine intelligence involving sight, sound, and touch. The overarching goal of my research is to enpower machines to emulate and enhance human capabilities in seeing, hearing, and feeling, ultimately enabling them to comprehensively perceive, understand, and interact with the multisensory world.
